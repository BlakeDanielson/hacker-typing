# Hacker Typing

A browser game simulating hacker typing and code generation.

## About

Hacker Typing is a fun, interactive web application that simulates the experience of being a "movie hacker." As you type randomly on your keyboard, realistic-looking code appears character by character, creating the illusion that you're a programming expert typing complex code at lightning speed.

## Features

- Realistic code generation as you type
- Multiple programming language options (JavaScript, Python, C++, Ruby)
- Sound effects for keypresses
- "Hacking complete" animations
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile play
- Customizable typing speed and visual effects

## How to Play

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Select a programming language from the dropdown menu
3. Start typing anywhere on your keyboard
4. Watch as realistic code appears on the screen
5. Complete the "hack" by filling the screen with code

## Technical Details

The application uses:

- HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript
- Pre-loaded code snippets for various programming languages
- Local storage for saving preferences
- CSS animations for visual effects

## Code Sources

The code snippets used in this application are sourced from:
- Open source projects (properly attributed)
- Educational programming examples
- Generated code samples

## Development

### Prerequisites

No special prerequisites needed - just a modern web browser!

### Local Setup
